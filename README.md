# TryHackMe-Walkthrough

# Network Services Analysis 🔍

This repository contains an analysis of network services, including enumeration, authentication testing, and service exploitation techniques.

## 📖 Documentation
All detailed findings, commands, and methodologies are documented in [`NetworkServices.md`](./NetworkServices.md).

## 🔹 Overview
This project involves identifying and analyzing open ports, checking service versions, and testing authentication mechanisms for potential vulnerabilities.

## 🚀 Tools & Techniques Used
The following tools and methodologies were used for enumeration, service analysis, and exploitation:

- **Nmap** – Scanning and enumerating open ports and services.
- **Enum4linux** – Enumerating SMB shares and user accounts.
- **Telnet** – Checking for accessible Telnet sessions.
- **FTP** – Accessing and analyzing anonymous FTP servers.
- **Hydra** – Performing brute-force attacks on authentication services.
- **Netcat (nc)** – Establishing reverse shells and network communication.
- **Msfvenom** – Generating payloads for command execution.

## 🔥 Key Areas Covered
- **Port scanning and service enumeration**
- **Analyzing FTP, SMB, and Telnet access**
- **Brute-force authentication testing**
- **Payload creation and execution**

## 🛠 How to Use
1. Read [`NetworkServices.md`](./NetworkServices.md) for full details.
2. Use the provided commands and techniques in a controlled environment.
3. Experiment responsibly and follow ethical guidelines.

## 🌍 TryHackMe Room
